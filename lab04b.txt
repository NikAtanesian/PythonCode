# Instead of just calling just a number, the function needs to call a random number in order for the loop to properly count the number of even and odd numbers.
# If it just calls a number, the loop alternates and results in 50/50 each time.
# However, because the variable is attached to the random number generator, the loop pays attention to each number and accurately states whether the number is even or odd.
